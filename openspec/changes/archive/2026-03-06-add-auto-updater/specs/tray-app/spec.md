## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tray context menu
The system SHALL provide a context menu when the user right-clicks (or clicks on macOS) the tray icon.

#### Scenario: Context menu contents
- **WHEN** the user activates the tray icon context menu
- **THEN** the menu displays: the list of configured mounts with their status (mounted/unmounted/error), a separator, "Add Mount...", "Settings...", "Check for Updates", "Sign Out", and "Quit"

#### Scenario: Dynamic menu rebuild
- **WHEN** mount state changes (mount started, stopped, added, removed, toggled, or authentication state changes) or update state changes (update downloaded, update pending)
- **THEN** the system SHALL rebuild the tray context menu to reflect the current mount list, status, and update state; each mount entry displays the mount name and its current state (Mounted, Unmounted, or Error)

#### Scenario: Open mount folder
- **WHEN** the user clicks on a mounted drive name in the tray menu
- **THEN** the system opens the mount point in the OS file manager (File Explorer, Finder, Nautilus/Dolphin)

#### Scenario: Mount/unmount toggle
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a mount entry in the tray menu
- **THEN** the system shows "Unmount" for active mounts or "Mount" for inactive mounts, and executes the chosen action

#### Scenario: Check for updates action
- **WHEN** the user selects "Check for Updates" from the tray menu and no update is pending
- **THEN** the system checks for updates and notifies the user of the result

#### Scenario: Restart to update action
- **WHEN** the user selects "Restart to Update (v{version})" from the tray menu
- **THEN** the system performs graceful shutdown and installs the pending update

#### Scenario: Sign out action
- **WHEN** the user selects "Sign Out" from the tray menu
- **THEN** the system stops all active mounts (flushing pending writes), clears authentication tokens from the OS keyring and encrypted file fallback, removes account metadata from user config, saves the config, and shows the sign-in wizard

#### Scenario: Quit action
- **WHEN** the user selects "Quit" from the tray menu
- **THEN** the system flushes all pending writes, unmounts all drives, stops the delta sync timer, and exits the process
