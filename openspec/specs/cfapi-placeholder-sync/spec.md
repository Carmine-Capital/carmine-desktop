## ADDED Requirements



### Requirement: Mount drive as native filesystem
The system SHALL mount a OneDrive or SharePoint drive as a native filesystem accessible by all applications on the operating system. Before the filesystem session is exposed to the OS, the system SHALL resolve the drive root item from the Graph API, register it in the inode table as ROOT_INODE (1), and seed it into the memory and SQLite caches. If the root item cannot be resolved, the mount SHALL fail with an error.
